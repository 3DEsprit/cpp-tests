#  C++ Tests/Practice: Beginning

This is my personal repository for the various C++ code I create as I go through the book [Beginning C++ 17](https://www.apress.com/us/book/9781484233658), as well as various C++ experimental mini-applications. 

## To All Viewers

All code written, especially the exercises I have written for the book itself (found in Exercise[chapter #] folders) are 100% open to critique and/or suggestions for better practices/idioms, and is extremely appreciative.

## To Others Also Looking to Master C++17

I am always willing to entertain the idea of paired-programmed practice projects, to help each other stengthen knowledge in this language. Feel free to message me on twitter (account found in profile), or start an issue discussing your interest. 

If you are on another platform (i.e. WinX, Linux, BSD), no worries, I have other development systems for each platform if needed, or welcome the idea of using CMake to make life easy, if it's a mutually agreeable solution.


## To Mentors

Mentors are definitely welcome! As a previous mentor for another language, I do know how feedback can impact the learning process no matter what the experience level. Feel free to reach out via Twitter or the Issues.
